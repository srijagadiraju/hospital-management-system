## Objective: 
The goal of this project is to create an app with frontend and backend capabilities using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and ES6. Due to us being able to choose any topic, we wanted to create something that related to something we are both passionate about, improving healthcare technology and streamlining medical care. With this goal in mind, we set out to create a hospital request inventory system that allowed any healthcare provider with credentials to the hospital to submit inventory item requests and view all current requests. This app is mainly intended for inventory managers at hospitals to use in order to ensure that all departments have adequate supplies and to ensure that the requests from providers are fulfilled as soon as possible. This project allowed us to understand more about the connections between the client and server side.
